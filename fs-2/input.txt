Requirements

    Write a C++ program simple-copy accepting two command line arguments representing source file path and destination file path.
    Implement proper error handling to account if not all arguments are passed or if one of arguments is not a valid one.
    Copy the content of the source file into a destination file. If destination file already exists, it should be overwritten.

Expected result

The resulting application should be able to build and execute from command line as follows:

make
./simple-copy source-file destination-file

The final solution should contain a Makefile for the multi-stage build. The Makefile should also contain targets all and clean. Itâ€™s recommended to have compiler and compiler flags to be declared as a Makefile variables. Alternatively, cmake could also be used instead of make.
